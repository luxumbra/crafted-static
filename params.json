Dave came to the Isle of Man in May 2015 and settled in the wonderful city of Peel. Working out of his humble home studio (I converted the garage), Daves current clients are located both on the Isle of Man and as far afield as Bristol and London in the UK but he would love to help more Manx based businesses realise their true potential online.\r\n\r\nA web designer and web developer specialising in WordPress development, responsive design and web standards, Dave prides himself on his attention to detail and the professional quality of his work. With a multitude of projects under his belt he is perfectly placed to turn your great ideas into a successful online venture that can flex and grow inline with your business strategy - whether it be maintenance for an existing concern or a ground up design & build service for a completely new venture, a wedding, christening or charity event, Dave has the skills and experience to help.\r\n\r\n#### Need a domain registered or hosting for your website?\r\n\r\nDave has been looking after the hosting and domain name registration needs of his clients for over ten years. Now a domain reseller, Dave is able to offer great prices for both hosting and domain registrations, often beating much larger competitors on price. With over 300 domain suffixes (including .im) to choose from, we are sure to find the right domain name for you. Dave can even get you up and running with your own email address.\r\n\r\n### A few good words from my old manager...\r\n\r\n> I hired Dave into my team of web developers at Future Publishing back in 2007. Those were heady days - we were tasked with building the websites for big, global brands in what often amounted to impossible timelines. Dave was a rock - dependable, self-motivated and crucially a calm and patient mentor for less experienced team members. Dave has a passion and pride in doing the right thing, and not just what is expedient and this had a real impact on the quality of the products we were building. On a personal level he is just the sort of person you want as part of a team. Both Dave and I have moved on to new things but I consider him a friend, and not just \"someone I once worked with\". If the opportunity presented itself I would not hesitate hiring him again. - Stefan Kruger, Future Publishing.\r\n\r\n### Noteworthy projects from recent years\r\n\r\n* Full Speed Ahead\r\n    Responsive HTML5, CSS3 wordpress development whilst freelancing for Hello Future Ltd.\r\n\r\n* Link 51\r\n    HTML5, CSS3 development whilst freelancing for Morgan Wylie.\r\n\r\n* Store Nextdoor\r\n    HTML5, CSS3 and Django template development.\r\n\r\n* Island Spirit\r\n    HTML5, CSS3 and Django template development whilst freelancing for Fez Consulting Ltd.\r\n\r\n* Fantasy Premier League 2011/12\r\n    HTML5, CSS3 and Django template development whilst contracting for ISM Games.\r\n\r\n    Whilst working for ISM I also worked on a number of other fantasy games, which due to their seasonal nature, are not all available to view online.
