<p>CrafteD is a Manx based one man web development and design studio servicing small &amp; medium businesses and sole traders in the Isle of Man and further afield.</p>

<p>Originally from Somerset in the UK, Dave Sayer, the man behind CrafteD, is a well seasoned web professional with over 15 years experience working within the web industry (both as a freelancer and agency employee). Dave came to the Isle of Man in May 2015 and settled in the wonderful city of Peel. Working out of his humble home studio (I converted the garage), Daves current clients are located both on the Isle of Man and as far afield as Bristol and London in the UK but he would love to help more Manx based businesses realise their true potential online.</p>

<p>A web designer and web developer specialising in WordPress development, responsive design and web standards, Dave prides himself on his attention to detail and the professional quality of his work. With a multitude of projects under his belt he is perfectly placed to turn your great ideas into a successful online venture that can flex and grow inline with your business strategy - whether it be maintenance for an existing concern or a ground up design &amp; build service for a completely new venture, a wedding, christening or charity event, Dave has the skills and experience to help.</p>

<p>Dave has been looking after the hosting and domain name registration needs of his clients for over ten years. Now a domain reseller, Dave is able to offer great prices for both hosting and domain registrations, often beating much larger competitors on price. With over 300 domain suffixes (including .im) to choose from, we are sure to find the right domain name for you. Dave can even get you up and running with your own email address.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I hired Dave into my team of web developers at Future Publishing back in 2007. Those were heady days - we were tasked with building the websites for big, global brands in what often amounted to impossible timelines. Dave was a rock - dependable, self-motivated and crucially a calm and patient mentor for less experienced team members. Dave has a passion and pride in doing the right thing, and not just what is expedient and this had a real impact on the quality of the products we were building. On a personal level he is just the sort of person you want as part of a team. Both Dave and I have moved on to new things but I consider him a friend, and not just "someone I once worked with". If the opportunity presented itself I would not hesitate hiring him again. - Stefan Kruger, Future Publishing.</p>
